    "### Data understanding\n",
    "As the world struggles to vaccinate the global population against COVID-19, an understanding of how peopleâ€™s backgrounds, opinions, gender, race, age, health behaviors and other features are related to their personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts. We try to understand better based on data collected to guide public health efforts in predicting whether one has a likelihood of contracting H1N! virus.\n",
